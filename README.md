# Battle Trap

![Game Preview](/public/img/game-preview.webp)

Battle trap is a single player and multiplayer game where you must last the longest in the board without colliding with another players trail. Inspired by Tron, players can move there player when it is their turn. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will need to override the models source, hosted on CDN by default. Add this env var globally.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MODEL_SOURCE = LOCAL
```

## Multiplayer

Aiming to have multiplayer via P2P and Websockets. Websocket backend code is not in this repo or available at this time. P2P code will be included here.

## Board Game Version

I originally made this game as a board game for my Game Design Merit Badge. Here are some files you can use to print and play!
